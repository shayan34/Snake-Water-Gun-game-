# Snake-Water-Gun-game-
Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player game played by many people. It is a hand game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake, water, and gun. Here, we are going to implement this game using python. 

This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer 

Following are the rules of the game:

Snake vs. Water: Snake drinks the water hence wins.
Water vs. Gun: The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
Gun vs. Snake: Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both players choose the same object, the result will be a draw.
